# Text-Emotions-Classification-using-Python

This project focuses on text classification using Keras to predict the emotions associated with a given text. The model uses a neural network architecture for multi-class classification based on a dataset of text and emotion labels.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes deep learning with Keras and TensorFlow to build a text classification model. The model classifies text into various emotions based on the training dataset. Key steps in the process include data preprocessing, tokenization, padding, encoding, and training the model. After training, the model predicts emotions for unseen text input.
